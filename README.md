# 🛡️ Mini-OWASP Scanner

A lightweight, open-source Python tool that performs basic web application security checks based on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

## 🚀 Features
- Checks if HTTPS is enforced
- Detects missing security headers:
  - Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Looks for potential Open Redirect vulnerabilities
- Scans for basic XSS patterns in form inputs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup4

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidtbilisi/scan_owasp.git
cd scan_owasp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📦 Install as CLI Tool

You can install and use as a CLI tool:

```bash
pip install .
scan-owasp https://example.com
```

## ⚡ Usage

Scan one or more URLs:

```bash
python scanner.py https://example.com http://test.com
```

Select specific checks (comma-separated):

```bash
python scanner.py https://example.com --checks https,headers,xss
```

Output results to a file (JSON or CSV):

```bash
python scanner.py https://example.com --output results.json
python scanner.py https://example.com --output results.csv
```

## 🔍 Checks Performed
- HTTPS enforcement
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- SQL Injection (basic error-based)
- Directory listing
- Reflected XSS (basic)
- Server version disclosure
- Open redirect
- Cookie security flags
- CORS policy
- Referrer policy
- HSTS preload
- Path traversal (basic)
- Information disclosure (headers, HTML comments)

## 🎯 CTF-Specific Modules

The scanner includes special modules for CTF platforms:

- **HackTheBox (htb_ctf)**: Searches for `HTB{}` flags, exposed robots.txt, .git/config, and common admin/dev endpoints. Useful for quickly spotting HackTheBox-style clues and misconfigurations.
- **TryHackMe (thm_ctf)**: Searches for `THM{}` and `FLAG{}` flags, exposed backup/config files, and CTF-style endpoints like `/flag`, `/secret`, `/hidden`, and `/.env`. Designed to help with TryHackMe-style CTFs.

You can run these checks with:

```bash
python scanner.py https://target --checks htb_ctf,thm_ctf
```

Findings from these modules are explained in the scan summary and can help you quickly identify flags, sensitive files, or endpoints during CTFs.

## 🏷️ Finding Severity

Each finding is assigned a severity level (High, Medium, Low, or Info) to help you prioritize remediation:

- **High**: Critical security risks (e.g., missing CSP, HSTS, open redirect, SQLi, XSS)
- **Medium**: Important but less critical (e.g., missing X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, directory listing)
- **Low**: Informational or minor issues (e.g., missing Referrer-Policy, cookie flags)
- **Info**: General information or errors

Severity is shown in the scan summary and output files.
